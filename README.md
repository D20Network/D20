## Introduction

Welcome to the D20Network Blockchain repository. This project is a product of the Void, Corp, a Utah-based software and hardware development company. Our goal is to utilize artificial intelligence (AI) and blockchain technology to enhance the tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs) experience.

## Overview

TTRPGs are a type of game in which players assume the role of a character and collaborate to tell a shared story. One of the key components of TTRPGs is character creation, which can be time-consuming and complex, especially for newer players. 

Our platform aims to use web 3.0 domains to store and view data, allowing for a more efficient and immersive gaming experience. We aim to use AI to allow solo players the chance to play, develop, and grow.

## Background

Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed ledger that allows for secure and transparent record-keeping. It has been utilized in a variety of industries, from finance to supply chain management, and has the potential to revolutionize many more. 

AI, on the other hand, has the potential to enhance the TTRPG experience by providing additional support for Dungeon Masters (DMs) and players.
